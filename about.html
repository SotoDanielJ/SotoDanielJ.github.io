    <p class="indent" style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">Hello! I’m Daniel Jose Soto, a Full Stack Java and C# Software Developer with a diverse background in Information Security Technology, Information Security Management, Human Resources, and Communications System Operations. With an active Secret Security Clearance, I have spent years utilizing, maintaining, and accounting for cryptographic hardware and software both inside and outside military operations. <br></p>
    <p class="indent" style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">I am a respected leader known for my excellent communication skills and experience in training highly motivated professionals to achieve goals in dynamic, fast-paced environments. My proficiency in Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook) coupled with my critical thinking, record-keeping, teamwork and collaboration, attention to detail, and policy implementation skills have been instrumental in my career. <br></p>
    <p class="indent" style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">During my tenure with the United States Marine Corps from April 2016 to September 2023, I held various roles where I demonstrated my ability to manage information security, personnel security, and human resources. I also operated communication systems, where I utilized, maintained, and accounted for over 500 cryptographic hardware and software assets valued at over $6M during military operations. <br></p>
    <p class="indent" style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;">In my most recent role as an Information Security Technician, I assisted in day-to-day cryptographic account management and safeguarded the organization’s cryptographic database. I performed maintenance functions and maintained 100% accountability of over 200 cryptographic hardware and software assets valued at over $20M. <br></p>
    <p style="padding-left: 5%; padding-right: 5%;;">Since my time in the Armed Forces, I have become a Full Stack Java and C# Software Developer, having completed a bootcamp with We Can Code It. This experience has further broadened my skill set and allowed me to bring a unique perspective to my work. <br></p>
    <p style="text-align: center; ">Feel free to browse my portfolio to see some of the projects I’ve worked on. If you have any questions or would like to discuss potential collaborations, please don’t hesitate to get in touch!</p>
